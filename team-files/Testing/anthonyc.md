# My Testing

I worked in the design and scraping portion of the application. The types of testing I used were Unit and Integration testing. In the beginning, I used Jest, which was a full-testing framework, for my Node.js code to check the scraper functions and do Unit tests to make sure each component was working correctly. During the process of using Jest as my testing framework, I found it to take up more of my time testing then actually writing code to get things to work properly, so I ended up taking out Jest all together. In replace of Jest, I did my own simple testing of functions using console.log() and basic Node.js function testing. Once I found my code to work independently, I would then test it within the full application itself to make sure the application worked correctly with it. Again, I did checks to make sure of this, by logging the output in various ways or checking the mobile view if it was the design.
